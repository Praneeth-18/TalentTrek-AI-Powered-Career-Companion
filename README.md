### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praneeth-18/TalentTrek-AI-Powered-Career-Companion.git
cd TalentTrek-AI-Powered-Career-Companion
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Database Connection
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://ttadmin:yourpassword@your-aws-rds-endpoint:5432/joblistingsportal"

# AWS Cognito Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_ID="us-east-2_XXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION="us-east-2"

# API Configuration
RESUME_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-jwt-secret"

# OpenAI Configuration (for AI Interviewer)
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
```

### Install Dependencies

For the main application:
```bash
npm install
```

For the resume service:
```bash
cd resume-service/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the AI Interviewer service:
```bash
cd AI_Interviewer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the job scraping scripts:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv py311env
source py311env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Components

Follow these steps in order:

#### 1. Job Scraper (Optional, for populating jobs)

Run the job scheduler to scrape and process job listings:
```bash
./run_job_scheduler.sh
```

This script will:
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Install required dependencies
- Run the job scraper to populate your database with job listings
- Process the listings and add them to the database

#### 2. Apply Links Processor (Optional)

For processing job application links:
```bash
./fetch_actual_links.sh
```

This script:
- Updates job listings with actual application links
- Improves the accuracy of application redirects

#### 3. Resume Service Backend

Start the resume customization service:
```bash
cd resume-service/backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This service will run on http://localhost:8000

#### 4. AI Interviewer Backend

Start the AI interviewer service:

##### Option 1: Direct Run
```bash
cd AI_Interviewer
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 5000
```

##### Option 2: Using Docker
```bash
cd AI_Interviewer
docker-compose up
```

The AI Interviewer service will run on http://localhost:5000 (direct run) or http://localhost:8000 (Docker)

#### 5. Main Application

Finally, start the main Next.js application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## üîÑ Updating Job Listings

The job listings are automatically fetched and updated by the job scheduler. If you need to manually update job listings:

1. Run the job scheduler script:
   ```bash
   ./run_job_scheduler.sh
   ```

2. For processing apply links:
   ```bash
   ./fetch_actual_links.sh
   ```

## üìä AWS RDS Database

The application uses AWS RDS PostgreSQL. Important notes:

- The database connection uses the `ttadmin` user, not the default `postgres` user
- All database operations connect to the RDS instance directly
- Job scraping scripts and the main application both use the same RDS instance
- The database contains job listings, user applications, and interaction history

## üß™ Authentication with AWS Cognito

The application uses AWS Cognito for authentication:

1. Users register through the Register page
2. Verification is sent to their email
3. After verification, users can log in
4. Authentication state is managed through the AuthContext provider

## üìù Resume Customization Service

The resume customization service allows users to:

1. Upload their basic resume
2. Select a job listing to apply for
3. Get an AI-customized resume tailored to that specific job
4. Download the customized resume as a PDF

## üéôÔ∏è AI Mock Interview Platform

The AI-powered mock interview platform enables users to:

1. Create a new interview session with job type selection
2. Conduct realistic mock interviews with AI interviewer
3. Use voice recording for answers with real-time transcription
4. Get AI-generated questions based on job type
5. Receive detailed feedback and evaluation scores
6. Review interview history and performance metrics
7. Listen to AI responses using text-to-speech

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Error message `no pg_hba.conf entry for host` - Make sure you're using `ttadmin` username in your connection string, not `postgres`
   - Verify the connection string in your `.env.local` file matches your AWS RDS instance
   - Check security group settings in AWS RDS to allow connections

2. **Application Errors**:
   - For Next.js errors, check the browser console and terminal
   - For Python script errors, check the log files in `scripts/logs/`

3. **Resume Service Issues**:
   - Ensure the Python environment has all required dependencies
   - Check if the service is running on the correct port

4. **AI Interviewer Issues**:
   - Verify the OpenAI API key is correctly set
   - For Docker issues, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
   - Check MySQL connection details in the docker-compose.yml file
